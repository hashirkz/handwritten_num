handwritten digit recognition neural network
dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv?resource=download

usage: first unzip the tar.gz files to train.csv and test.csv and it should work

this repo is my attempt at training a neural network using tensorflow and the typical example of handwritten digits
